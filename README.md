# Knights
Raymond Smullyan, in his book of logical puzzles, "What is the name of this book?", published a class of puzzles called "Knights and Knaves" puzzles.
In the puzzle, each character is a knight or a knave. A knight will always tell the truth and a knave will always lie.
Given a set of sentences spoken by each of the characters, we have to determine, for each character, whether that character is a knight or a knave.
This project is a part of CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course.
